I INSTALLED LINEAGEOS ON MY JUNKIE PHONE!

The phone was my mom's old phone (it's an Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1). Its screen has cracked but it's not too old. I've been looking for a suitable custom ROM to play around that has a lot of device support and [LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) it is!! They got bunch of hardware, that's amazing. Kudos.

So, my journey began yesterday. I followed the installation step [here](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/X00TD/install). I got stuck when flashing the recovery image though. I waited for around 2 hours but the command doesn't complete. The next day (today), I used my other laptop to flash it and it finally works! (really quickly, like, less than a second). I then continued the rest of the steps and *voilà*!.

Nothing hard, obviously, but I just feel really happy! Finally, I have a device I can use without feeling too anxious about my data. But I can't completely daily drive it since I still need "normal people" stuff or else I will be dropped from my school and ruin my life.
