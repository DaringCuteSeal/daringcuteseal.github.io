ALRIGHT SO UHHH MY LFS ISN'T GOING VERY WELL

I ONLY UNDERSTAND LIKE HALF OF THE THING SAID THERE.. ESPECIALLY THE CROSS COMPILER PART.. IT'S LIKE READING NONSENSE!! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT

I'm now stuck at compiling libstdc++ where it just throws me bunch of errors about some kind of undeclared functions or some sort of that.. I don't know.. but I suspect it's because the glibc version I used to compile the temporary toolchain thing is one version behind the glibc I use for the LFS install

Argh idk-
