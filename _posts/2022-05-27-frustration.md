Hey, little personal post. I'm just anxious and have nowhere to talk about it.

It's almost my final test on 7th grade! I can't believe it. I spent like 7/8 of the time at home, and since the Corona pandemic just got better here, we just went back to school *very* recently.

So uh yeah, help. I'm afraid for the test. I don't quite have a close friend now to talk to (somehow my best friend hasn't talked to me for a while :<). Not a trully smart kid but I'm pretty decent. Well, except for (Arch™) Linux stuff, hey, I'm pretty experienced, you know. 

And lastly I think I should `git push` this post and stop procrastinating. Bye!
